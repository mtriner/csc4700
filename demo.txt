What is your favorite movie?
    My favorite movie is Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
    Japan.

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
    Probably the ability to shoot spaghetti out of my fingers. Infinite food and the ability to tangle people up with spaghetti. I just see so many potential uses for this. Cooked spaghetti of course, if it was uncooked not only is it inedible but also it won't wrap around bad guys. I'd go by the name Spaghetto.
